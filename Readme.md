# Project name - evalU
# What is evalU and what we do with that?
### evalU is an assessment application which is used to create a question by ourselves and we can play some interesting quiz games when we feel bored. Initially it is only for academy students. 


# Why did I choose evalU ?
### I like to do something for the academy, which will be useful for the upcoming students. I have used some assessment apps, when I studied, I was confused to use that kind of applications. That why I chose to create an application which can be easily accessed by an user, CRISP & CLEAR.
