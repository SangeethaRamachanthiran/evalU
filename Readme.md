# Project name - evalU
# What is evalU and what we do with that?
### It is an assessment application, which is very useful to the students and coaches. Here, both students and coaches can create a question for their respective teams and team members can attend the test when they are free using the code.


# Why did I choose evalU ?
### I have used some assessment app before, at that time I was thinking how its working and how they designed. Luckily for my final project, It came to my attention and I was excited to do that. So, that is the reason why I choose EVAL U.
