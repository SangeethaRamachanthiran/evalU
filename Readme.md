# What is evalU and what we do with that?
### evalU is an assessment application which is used to create a question by ourselves and we can play some interesting quiz games when we feel bored. Initially it is only for academy students. 
# Why I choose this project ?
### I like to do something for the academy, which is very helpful for the upcoming students. I have used some assessment apps, when I studied, I have confused to use that kind of application. That why I choose to create a application like CRISP & CLEAR.
